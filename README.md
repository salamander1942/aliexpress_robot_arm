# aliexpress_robot_arm
this is the code i wrote to control an aliexpress robot arm

It is intended to run with the esp32 running micropython

servo ZB is the servo moving the base up and down

servo 7 rotates the base

servo c is the servo moving the angle on the arm

in the future I intend on a video explenation of the math
